- Drafted `AGENTS.md` with MVP scope, UI requirements, and markdown course spec plus LLM prompt format.
- Initialized git repo and added example resources.
- Scaffolded Next.js + Tailwind app; set Odyssey theme variables and fonts.
- Built landing page with prompt box, curated course cards, and placeholder art.
- Added generate flow with loading animation and redirect to course page.
- Implemented markdown course loader and block parser.
- Built course player with outline sidebar and block renderer.
- Implemented interactive blocks: lessons, study guide, quizzes, flashcards, final exam, podcast UI.
- Added three sample markdown courses and SVG placeholder heroes.
- Fixed build/runtime issues:
  - Escaped `>` in JSX on landing page.
  - Moved block renderer to client component to avoid `next/dynamic` SSR restriction.
  - Awaited async `params` in dynamic route for Next.js 16.
  - Quoted YAML titles with colons.
  - Tightened block typing for proper discriminated unions.
  - Wrapped `useSearchParams()` in Suspense and split generate page into client component.
- Clarified Render deploy config: use web service, no publish directory, `npm run build` + `npm run start`.
- Improved reliability and UX flow:
  - Replaced risky navigation/image patterns with `Link` and `Image` where needed.
  - Removed remote Google font dependency to make builds deterministic in restricted environments.
  - Added `Example Resources/**` to ESLint ignores to avoid noise from reference assets.
- Upgraded generation flow and course player:
  - Changed prompt flow to landing -> loading -> `/generate/choose` course selection page.
  - Added `CoursePlayerClient` with active block tracking via intersection observer.
  - Updated outline sidebar to anchor to blocks and include unchaptered wrap-up items.
- Hardened markdown/content rendering:
  - Added defensive parsing/normalization for questions, cards, and metadata.
  - Added duplicate block id warnings and graceful fallbacks for empty quiz/flashcards/final exam blocks.
- Added release/versioning workflow:
  - Added commit-time version bump automation (`+0.0.1`) via `.githooks/pre-commit`.
  - Added `lib/version.ts` as app version source and rendered version badge at bottom-right on every page.
  - Synced version updates across `README.md`, `package.json`, and `package-lock.json`.
- Added branch/worktree operations tooling:
  - Added concise branch summary generator and docs in `docs/branch-summaries/`.
  - Added worktree bootstrap script for sequenced feature branches.
  - Executed integration merge flow and pushed `main` plus supporting branches to remote.
  - Tagged release `v0.2.5` on commit `8d548db`.
- Completed cleanup:
  - Pruned temporary local worktrees, leaving only the primary repo worktree on `main`.
