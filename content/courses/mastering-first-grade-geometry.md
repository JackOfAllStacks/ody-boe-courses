title: What Makes a Shape?
summary: Learn how to spot sides, corners, and curves.
---
A shape is a way to describe the outline of something. Some shapes are made of straight sides and sharp corners, while others are smooth and round. When we talk about shapes, we usually notice three things:

- Sides: the straight edges of a shape.
- Corners: the points where sides meet.
- Curves: rounded edges with no corners.

Learning to name these features helps you spot shapes everywhere, from street signs to puzzle pieces.

title: Meet the 3D Shapes
summary: Discover shapes you can hold and stack.
---
3D shapes are solid objects. You can pick them up, turn them around, and see all their sides. A cube looks like a dice, a sphere looks like a ball, and a cylinder looks like a can.

Try to spot these in the room around you. Finding them in real life makes geometry feel familiar.

title: Directions and Positions
summary: Use words like left, right, above, and below.
---
Spatial language tells us where things are. If a book is above the table, you look up. If a toy is below the chair, you look down. These words help us give clear directions.

Practice by describing where objects are in a picture or around your desk.

title: Patterns and Symmetry
summary: Find repeating shapes and balanced designs.
---
Patterns repeat in a predictable way. Symmetry means both sides match like a mirror. When you spot patterns, you can guess what comes next. When you spot symmetry, you can see balance.

Try folding paper shapes to see if both halves match.
